## Improving communication efficiency between UAV and it's ground segment
**Abstract:**
*Using high gain, directional antennas in order to increase link range and quality is a widely used practice in micro-wave radio-frequency communication. The more directional the antenna is the more focused the electromagnetic power will be. Hence continuous optical view between the antennas and precise antenna moving and aiming become a critical asset. This is no different in case of point-to–point microwave links between UAVs and their ground control stations. But the UAVs are in continuous movement and they are capable of executing rapid maneuvers. Therefore, a need arises for a device which can track automatically the UAV and point the ground station’s antenna at it continuously. In this paper I present in detail a GPS based automatic UAV antenna tracker, which has been developed. I describe the necessary algorithms, and finally how it was tested both with generated and real life inputs.*

## Analysis of Ukrain's crowdfunded military purpose octocopters
**Abstract:**
*Due to the Eastern Ukrainian war several groups has been established in Ukraine. Their definitive goal to help the Ukrainian military. In this article the author analyzes in details and demonstrates the drones built and used by one of these irregular military groups, namely the Aerorozvidka. The analysis based on their appearances in the news, social media, and interviews with the members. The aim of this publication is to promptly specify those widespread off-the-shelf parts which are widely used in civilian and industrial UAV applications and this self-organized group is using also for air reconnaissance and information gathering on a regular basis in order to support the Ukrainian army, their artillery and the decision making processes.*

**Keywords:** UAV, Aerorozvidka, crowdfunded war, war startup

## Challenges of defense against drones
**Abstract:**
*As a result of technological advances in recent years, basically anyone can afford an unmanned aerial vehicle. The complexity of the tasks, performed by drones is increasing. Their flight time, flight range, and other abilities are rising as their prices are decreasing. Today the line between civilian and military drones is getting blurred. There are plenty of evidence for civilian drones, intended for recreational or industrial purposes are not only used for peaceful purposes.The proliferation of commercial off-the-shelf drones means emerging risk. The public and the scientific world is divided by the widespread of commercially available small aircraft systems. Some people welcome the increasing capability of drones and they would use them as soon as possible, despite the many existing unanswered questions. Others are doubting the sustainability of the commercial drone trends. Drones cannot be treated as toys anymore. It is necessary to find viable methods and solutions to ensure safety. Therefore the aim of this research is to analyze the requirements and methods of identification and countering drones. Investigate the currently existing capabilities and propose possible solutions to mitigate the risks.*

**Results:** *In the course of my research, I found that the process of defense against drones can be divided into a couple of well-defined steps. One of these is the identification which is a crucial and important decision making point, regarding the whole defense process. I analyzed and systematized the requirements and the currently available tools and possible methods of both protection against drones, and drone identification from multiple perspectives. I also found that there is no a single, widely accepted way of remote drone identification and the regarding laws are yet to be implemented.*

**Conclusions:** *The wide spread of commercial drones means emerging, new kind of threats despite the many positive use cases of drone technology. These threats must be mitigated to maintain safety and to keep the drone industry on a developing track. To this end new laws, and the supporting technology is required, especially in the field of remote drone identification, drone detection and disabling drones.*

## Drone Remote Identification
**Abstract:**
*The public and the scientific world is divided by the widespread of commercially available small aircraft systems. Some people welcome the increasing capability of drones and would use them as soon as possible despite the many unanswered questions. Others are doubting the sustainability of current commercial drone usage trends. It’s obvious that drones cannot be treatedas toys anymore. There are numerous risks beside the many positives in case of the most selling drones. Therefore the two sides are agree on that one of the biggest obstacles in front of the drone industry is the identification, thus it has to be addressed and solved as soon as possible.The publication presents the problems of drone identification, highlights the relationship with counter unmanned aircraft vehicle technologies. Describes the definitions and requirements of remote drone identification. Finally presents the groups of available technologies through examples and compares their advantages and disadvantages.*

## Threats against drones from cyberspace
**Abstract:**
*The publication addresses the question whether commercially available unmanned aircraft(commonly known as drones), which are becoming increasingly popular today and are freelyaccessible to anyone, are exposed to various cyberspace threats or not. It describes the definitionof cyberspace and the unmanned aerial vehicle system, presents the general structure and components of such a system and points out the relationship between the two. It then briefly describes the attack vectors and methods that pose an existing cyberspace threat to unmannedaerial vehicles. Finally, the publication also discusses how these solutions can be used in defense against unmanned aerial vehicles.*

## The potential of fifth generation mobile networks for unmanned aerial vehicle systems
**Abstract:**
*A publikáció röviden bemutatja a mobilhálózatok legújabb, ötödik generációját. Annak működési alapjait, fontosabb jellemzőit valamint a technológiai sajátosságait. Ezeket alapul véve összehasonlítja azt a korábbi generációkkal. Ismerteti az esetleges hasonlóságokat és a kulcsfontosságú eltéréseket egyaránt. Az összehasonlítás különös hangsúlyt fektet a pilóta nélküli légijármű-rendszerek és az azokra épülő alkalmazások szempontjára. Ezt követően megfogalmazásra kerülnek e rendszerek vezeték nélküli kommunikációval szemben támasztott igényei és minimális követelményei. Végül a tanulmány rámutat a főbb kapcsolódási pontokra a korszerű telekommunikációs technológiák és a pilóta nélküli légijármű-rendszerek között, valamint bemutatja a kettő összekapcsolásában rejlő lehetőségeket és azok előnyeit.*
