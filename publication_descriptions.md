## Improving communication efficiency between UAV and it's ground segment
**Abstract:**
*Using high gain, directional antennas in order to increase link range and quality is a widely used practice in micro-wave radio-frequency communication. The more directional the antenna is the more focused the electro-magnetic power will be.Hence continuous optical view between the antennas and precise antenna moving and aiming become a critical asset. This is no different in case of point-to –point microwave links between UAVs and their ground control stations. But the UAVs are in continuous movement and they are capable of executing rapid maneuvers. Therefore,a need arises for a device which can track automatically the UAV and point the ground station’s antenna at it con-tinuously. In this paper I present in detail a GPS based automatic UAV antenna tracker, which has been developed. I describe the necessary algorithms, and finally how it was tested both with generated and real life inputs.*

## Analysis of Ukrain's crowdfunded military purpose octocopters
**Abstract:**
*Due to the Eastern Ukrainian war several groups has been established in Ukraine. Their definitive goal to help the Ukrainian military. In this article the author analyzes in details and demonstrates the drones built and used by one of these irregular military groups, namely the Aerorozvidka. The analysis based on their appearances in the news, social media, and interviews with the members. The aim of this publication is to promptly specify those widespread off-the-shelf parts which are widely used in civilian and industrial UAV applications and this self-organized group is using also for air reconnaissance and information gathering on a regular basis in order to support the Ukrainian army, their artillery and the decision making processes.*
