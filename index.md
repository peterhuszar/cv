### Embedded Hardware/Software Engineer - 2 years 1 month
*[Complex Systems & Small Satellites (C3S) LLC.](https://www.c3s.hu/) Budapest, Hungary (2018.12. - 2021.01.)*

As a software developer at C3S I spent most of my time implementing Python scripts and tools and I also participated in the embedded satellite C source code in the form of bug fixes and code maintenance. I performed measurements on the satellite hardware to verify the functionality of the embedded source code. Besides that my main task were to automate processes like code quality inspections and implement scripts which can be used to generate source code (C, Cpp, NodeJS), configuration files used for the satellite communication packets, reports and documentations. During our work we worked together closely with international partners such as the European Space Agency (ESA). I also participated in project preparation. I got entrusted to present the results of our company on a scientific conference and to take part in a paper on CubeSat development.

### Hardware Engineer - 1 year 9 months
*[thyssenkrupp E/E Competence Center](https://www.thyssenkrupp.hu/en/sites/budapest) Budapest, Hungary (2017.03. - 2018.11.)*

At Thyssenkrupp my job was to develop, test and verify a new generation of steering systems intended to be used in self-driving cars. I designed the layout of the high current circuitry and I also took part in the design of the digital circuitry. I performed thermal measurements on the whole system in order to improve the layout. I started to use Python at Thyssenkrupp to collect data automatically with laboratory equipment during measurements, to condition and process the gathered data and finally to generate the required documentation and verify the results. I gained a lot of experience with thermal cameras, thermal chambers, special PCB technologies like IMS and high temperature FR4 and with Python scripting during the time I spent there.

### Elecrical Engineer - 1 year 1 month
*[German Aerospace Center ( Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt - DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/content/de/standort/bremen.html) Bremen, Germany (2015.10. - 2016.10.)*

As a hardware designer intern my task was to design a three channel (X,Y,Z) high resolution ADC unit for seismical data acquisition, a main on board computer unit with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, Wifi connection and other necessary peripherials, and finally an interface unit for the ROBEX (Robotic Exploration of Extreme Environments-Helmholz Alliance) project. I was responsible for the whole design and manufacturing process. I gained a lot of new experience with Altium designer and different kind of simulation programs, in the field of high resolution delta sigma ADCs and load cell amplifiers and in addition I feel lucky to had the opportunity to work with a very international team.

### Electrical Engineer - 4 months
*[Hetronic Malta Ltd.](https://www.hetronic.com/) Mriehel, Malta (2015.06. - 2015.09.)*

As an intern I had quality assurance based tasks, jig and hardware designing with the aim of improving test methods and procedures. I leraned a lot about production cell auditing and layerd process auditing, quality control plans and how to make and improve these plans. Furthermore I experienced how to work and communicate with a culturally very divers team.

### DSP Laboratory Demonstrator - 1 semester
*Obuda University Budapest, Hungary (2016.09. - 2016.12.)*

As a laboratory demonstrator I presented to younger engineering students how to use digital signal processors (DSPs), write small applications in assembly language and how to measure them properly. I gained lot of useful experiences about teaching, encouraging, and dealing with others, I really enjoyed to work as a demonstrator.

## Hobbies
To my big surprise I got hooked on running in the recent years. An activity what I really hated back in the days though. I also like playing the guitar and reading about a wide variety of topics.
