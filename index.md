## Work Experiences by Relevance

### Embedded Hardware/Software Engineer - 2 years 1 month
*[Complex Systems & Small Satellites (C3S) LLC.](https://www.c3s.hu/) Budapest, Hungary (2018.12. - 2021.01.)*


### Elecrical Engineering Intern - 1 year 1 month
*[German Aerospace Center ( Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt - DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/content/de/standort/bremen.html) Bremen, Germany (2015.10. - 2016.10.)*

As a hardware designer my task was to design a three channel (X,Y,Z) high resolution ADC unit for seismical data acquisition, a main on board computer unit with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, Wifi connection and other necessary peripherials, and finally an interface unit for the ROBEX (Robotic Exploration of Extreme Environments-Helmholz Alliance) project. I was responsible for the whole design and manufacturing process. I gained a lot of new experience with Altium designer and different kind of simulation programs, in the field of high resolution delta sigma ADCs and load cell amplifiers and in addition I feel lucky to had the opportunity to work with a very international team.

### Electrical Engineering Intern - 4 months
*[Hetronic Malta Ltd.](https://www.hetronic.com/) Mriehel, Malta (2015.06. - 2015.09.)*

I had quality assurance based tasks, jig and hardware designing with the aim of improving test methods and procedures. I leraned a lot about production cell auditing and layerd process auditing, quality control plans and how to make and improve these plans. Furthermore I experienced how to work and communicate with a culturally very divers team.

### Hardware Engineer - 1 year 9 months
*[thyssenkrupp E/E Competence Center](https://www.thyssenkrupp.hu/en/sites/budapest) Budapest, Hungary (2017.03. - 2018.11)*

### DSP Laboratory Demonstrator - 1 semester
*Obuda University Budapest, Hungary (2016.09 - 2016.12.)*

As a laboratory demonstrator I presented to younger engineering students how to use digital signal processors (DSPs), write small applications in assembly language and how to measure them properly. I gained lot of useful experiences about teaching, encouraging, and dealing with others, I really enjoyed to work as a demonstrator.
