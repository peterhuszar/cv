### Elecrical Engineer - 1 year 1 month
*[German Aerospace Center ( Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt - DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/content/de/standort/bremen.html) Bremen, Germany (2015.10. - 2016.10.)*

As a hardware designer intern my task was to design a three channel (X,Y,Z) high resolution ADC unit for seismical data acquisition, a main on board computer unit with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, Wifi connection and other necessary peripherials, and finally an interface unit for the ROBEX (Robotic Exploration of Extreme Environments-Helmholz Alliance) project. I was responsible for the whole design and manufacturing process. I gained a lot of new experience with Altium designer and different kind of simulation programs, in the field of high resolution delta sigma ADCs and load cell amplifiers and in addition I feel lucky to had the opportunity to work with a very international team.

### Electrical Engineer - 4 months
*[Hetronic Malta Ltd.](https://www.hetronic.com/) Mriehel, Malta (2015.06. - 2015.09.)*

As an intern I had quality assurance based tasks, jig and hardware designing with the aim of improving test methods and procedures. I leraned a lot about production cell auditing and layerd process auditing, quality control plans and how to make and improve these plans. Furthermore I experienced how to work and communicate with a culturally very divers team.
