## Improving communication efficiency between UAV and it's ground segment
Abstract:
*Using high gain, directional antennas in order to increase link range and quality is a widely used practice in micro-wave radio-frequency communication. The more directional the antenna is the more focused the electro-magnetic power will be.Hence continuous optical view between the antennas and precise antenna moving and aiming become a critical asset. This is no different in case of point-to –point microwave links between UAVs and their ground control stations. But the UAVs are in continuous movement and they are capable of executing rapid maneuvers. Therefore,a need arises for a device which can track automatically the UAV and point the ground station’s antenna at it con-tinuously. In this paper I present in detail a GPS based automatic UAV antenna tracker, which has been developed. I describe the necessary algorithms, and finally how it was tested both with generated and real life inputs.*
